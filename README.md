# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model is based on historical data of resale flat transactions and aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Skills Acquired

- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building
- Model Deployment

## Domain

Real Estate

## Problem Statement

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, making it challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate resale prices based on factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. The model will help users make informed decisions about buying or selling flats.

## Motivation

Estimating resale prices accurately is crucial in Singapore’s competitive real estate market. A predictive model will aid users by providing estimated resale prices based on various influencing factors, thus overcoming challenges associated with accurate pricing.

## Scope

The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) from 1990 to the present.
   - Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
   - Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose and train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) on the historical data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

5. **Streamlit Web Application**:
   - Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input flat details and get resale price predictions.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform (or any cloud platform) to make it accessible online.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Thoroughly test the application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

## Deliverables

- A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
- A user-friendly web application deployed on a cloud platform.
- Documentation and instructions for using the application.
- A project report summarizing data analysis, model development, and deployment.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Singapore Government Data API. You can access it [here](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/view).

## Results

The application will benefit buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market by providing estimates of resale prices. It showcases the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
